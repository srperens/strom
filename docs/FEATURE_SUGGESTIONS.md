- **Live pipeline metrics**: CPU usage, memory consumption, bitrate, frame rate, buffer levels
- **Performance graphs**: Historical data visualization with time-series charts
- **Alert system**: Configurable thresholds for errors, dropped frames, buffer underruns
- **Resource usage tracking**: Per-pipeline and system-wide resource monitoring

**Why valuable**: Critical for production deployments where pipeline health monitoring is essential for maintaining service quality and detecting issues early.

**Implementation considerations**:
- Integrate GStreamer's tracer subsystem for detailed metrics
- Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time metric streaming
