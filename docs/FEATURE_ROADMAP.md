# Strom Feature Roadmap

A prioritized list of killer features to enhance Strom's capabilities as a visual GStreamer pipeline editor.

---

## Tier 1: High Impact / High Feasibility

### 1. Flow Templates & Quick Start Gallery

Pre-built templates that dramatically lower the barrier to entry and showcase Strom's capabilities.

**Examples:**
- Live Stream to YouTube/Twitch
- RTSP to SRT Relay
- Multi-camera Compositor
- AES67 Studio Intercom
- Webcam to WebRTC
- File Transcoding Pipeline
- NDI to SDI Bridge

**Implementation:**
- One-click deployment with parameter wizards
- Categorized gallery view in UI
- User can save their own flows as templates

---

### 2. Live Parameter Tweaking with Visual Preview

Real-time adjustments for running pipelines with immediate visual feedback.

**Current status:** ✅ Basic live parameter editing works - properties can be changed on running pipelines. Audio level meter block (`builtin.meter`) available.

**Remaining features:**
- Real-time thumbnail previews embedded in graph nodes
- Audio/video scopes: waveform, vectorscope, histogram overlays
- Parameter interpolation for smooth transitions

**Why it matters:** Broadcasting professionals expect this level of control. No open-source competitor offers this integrated experience.

---

### 3. Multi-Flow Orchestration & Routing Matrix

Enable complex broadcast workflows by routing outputs between flows dynamically.

**Current status:** ✅ Compositor block with 11 layout templates (multiview, PIP, side-by-side, grids, etc.) and visual editor. ✅ Inter Input/Output blocks for cross-flow routing. ✅ Audio Router block with multi-input channel routing matrix. ✅ Audio Mixer block with 32 channels, aux sends, and groups.

**Remaining features:**
- Tally/program/preview bus concept for live switching
- Global audio/video buses

**Use cases:**
- Live production switching
- Multi-channel encoding from single source
- Redundant path failover

---

### 4. Pipeline Health Dashboard

Comprehensive monitoring for production deployments.

**Metrics:**
- Real-time graphs: bitrate, frame drops, buffer levels, latency
- Per-element QoS visualization
- CPU/GPU/memory utilization per pipeline
- Network I/O statistics

**Alerting:**
- Configurable thresholds
- Notifications via webhook, email, Slack, PagerDuty
- Alert history and acknowledgment

**Historical:**
- Time-range selection for metrics
- Export to Prometheus/Grafana

---

## Tier 2: Strategic Differentiators

### 5. AI Pipeline Assistant (Enhanced MCP)

Leverage the existing MCP infrastructure to provide intelligent assistance.

**Current status:** ✅ MCP server with Streamable HTTP (`/api/mcp`) and stdio transports. Supports flow management, element discovery, and pipeline control. SSE events for real-time updates.

**Future capabilities:**
- Natural language pipeline creation: *"Create a pipeline that takes RTSP, adds a logo overlay, and outputs to SRT"*
- Error diagnosis: *"My pipeline is dropping frames"* → AI analyzes QoS data and suggests fixes
- Auto-optimization based on hardware detection
- Element recommendation based on use case

**Implementation:**
- Enhance MCP server with diagnostic tools
- Add system introspection capabilities
- Train/prompt for GStreamer domain knowledge

---

### 6. Flow Version Control & Rollback

Git-like history for pipeline configurations.

**Features:**
- Automatic versioning on every save
- Compare versions side-by-side (visual diff)
- One-click rollback to previous configuration
- Branch flows for A/B testing
- Commit messages and annotations

**Why it matters:** Critical for production safety. No competitor offers this for media pipelines.

---

### 7. Scheduled Pipeline Operations

Enable unattended operation and broadcast automation.

**Features:**
- Cron-style scheduling: *"Start at 08:00, stop at 18:00"*
- Calendar integration (iCal, Google Calendar)
- Event-based triggers (file arrival, API webhook)
- Failover rules: *"If source fails, switch to backup flow"*

**Use cases:**
- Scheduled broadcasts
- Automated recording windows
- Time-based source switching

---

### 8. Remote Source Preview & Confidence Monitoring

Multi-viewer style monitoring for all running pipelines.

**Current status:** ✅ Audio Meter block with RMS and peak level monitoring per channel. ✅ WHEP Output block with built-in browser player pages for live preview. ✅ Links page for quick access to WHEP player pages and stream URLs.

**Remaining features:**
- Thumbnail grid of all active pipelines
- Customizable multiviewer layout builder
- Full-screen preview on click
- Source labeling and status indicators

**Why it matters:** Standard requirement for broadcast control rooms.

---

## Tier 3: Platform Play

### 9. Kubernetes Operator & Auto-Scaling

Enterprise-grade deployment capabilities.

**Features:**
- Custom Kubernetes operator for Strom flows
- Deploy flows as K8s pods with resource limits
- Auto-scale based on viewer count, CPU, or custom metrics
- Geographic distribution for CDN-like deployments
- Helm charts for easy installation

**Benefits:**
- Horizontal scaling for large events
- High availability with pod redundancy
- Integration with cloud-native tooling

---

### 10. Plugin/Block Marketplace

Community-driven extensibility.

**Features:**
- Browse and install community-contributed blocks
- Rating and review system
- Documentation and usage examples
- Semantic versioning for blocks
- One-click install from UI

**Categories:**
- Video effects and filters
- Audio processing
- Protocol adapters
- Hardware integrations
- AI/ML inference blocks

---

### 11. Multi-User Collaboration

Team workflows and enterprise access control.

**Features:**
- Real-time collaborative editing (Figma-style)
- Cursor presence and user indicators
- Role-based permissions (viewer/editor/admin)
- Per-flow access control
- Comprehensive audit logging

**Implementation:**
- WebSocket-based operational transforms or CRDTs
- User management API
- Integration with LDAP/OIDC

---

### 12. Recording & Replay System

Essential for live production workflows.

**Features:**
- One-click recording of any flow output
- Timeline-based clip marking during recording
- Instant replay capability with variable speed
- Automatic file segmentation
- Integration with storage backends (local, S3, NFS)

**Use cases:**
- Sports instant replay
- Event archiving
- Compliance recording
